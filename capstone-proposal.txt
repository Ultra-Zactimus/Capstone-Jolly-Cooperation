Name of Student: Zachary Green

Name of Project: Jolly Cooperation

Project’s Purpose or Goal: This application is meant to be a supplemental resources for video gamers who want to do multiplayer, but lack friends to play online with, or are playing a game that doesnt already offer good ways for players to connect with one another. In my years of playing video games there have been several games like Destiny 1 and the Dark Souls games where there arent great ways to match make for some of the online aspects of the game. In Destiny 1 if you wanted to do a raid, you had to essentially look at all of the names of players in the Tower social area and then write down their user name and send them a private message on PlayStation Network asking them if they wanted to play and half the time people wouldn't respond. This application is meant to solve this problem by giving players 1 location where they can post in a forum like setting to get co-op play going.

List of the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

So this project must have a splash page with sections for what topic the messages are going to be. So far I know that I want to have a GENERAL section for players who just want to chat and this will be a reserved channel for just that. I also want to have sections on this splash page for the console names so XBOX, PLAYSTATION, NINTENDO, PC. Each of the console tabs should have a list of games that will pull up. Clicking on these will bring the users to the User Posts. Posts need to be able to be sorted by the User by Date.

A Posting a new message must require the user has created an account on the page to prevent bots and people who want to come in and be malicious. A message Post must be tracked by time it was posted and must contain fields for:
PLATFORM (do they play on PC? Xbox),
MESSAGE(What area of the game are they in? What specifically do they need help on? Etc.),
TAGS(GamerId, and possibly what level they are etc)

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP?:

The goal here is to use this capstone to solve a problem that has always bugged me about gaming, but more important than that to use my skills to create a mobile application.

I will be using:
-React Native (specifically Expo)
-Android Studio (maybe also an application for IPhone if I have time)
-Some sort of database to store forum data on application close. Need to do some research, but possibly NoSQL?
-Styling (I could be okay with CSS, but if I have time I would like to explore my options)
-I am going to be using zophar.net's forum structure as a template for how I imagine my MVP structure to look like, but it's not exclusive to this website.
-After talking to Ella from the Uppercohort I dont think I am going to need to learn any new languages using Expo, but if I end up having to, it's going to be Kotlin because React Native uses Kotlin for Android apps and Objective C for IPhone.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: 
So I plan to make this project a fully fleshed out application, even if it takes me months after class is over to complete it, but some of the stretch goals for this project would include:
-User's being able to upload video gameplay to a HELP section where players can get help on games. This would require some deep research into what would be considered fair-use, by the game companies so this might be one of the last things I would add.
-I want to have a setup for the page where players can have their personal info on their account and get SMS or even APP notifications when players respond to their message. That way they dont have to have the application open to get updates on posts.
-I would like the game library and console library for choices to be extensive. To keep my MVP reachable I am probably going to only include maybe 3 to 4 games to choose and a handful of consoles, but I want this app to be used in the real world, so I would want this more fleshed out.
-I would like to have a sort of reward system that rewards users who are constantly helping out other players on games. I am not sure how I would handle these rewards but it could be something as simple as like a Player rating system where they could get a trophy next to their name. This however would require a lot of work, because I would have to keep track of potentially thousands of users and have to build out a way for a user to rate another user and track that it isnt people abusing the platform.
-Obviously another goal would be to have this application available on all mobile platforms. I am only going with Android Studio because in the off chance that Expo doesnt work and I have to switch to React Native, Windows computers cannot make apps for IPhone I would need a Macbook and my Macbook is a dinosaur.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
